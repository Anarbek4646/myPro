                  constantly increasing the speed and scale of analysis in terms of information processing and accessibility to succeed in the face of unprecedented market change in point.</li><br>
            <li>Next-generation technologies are proving to be instrumental in accelerating digital transformation and enabling organizations to improve the quality of their processes. At the same time, software testing also plays a key role in
              providing a three-factor advantage: speed, value, and quality.</li><br>
            <li>At the moment, the future is near, the changes will be massive and in many ways - AI will be implemented to perform a number of actions, including interaction with end users. This is true for almost all technologies that are gaining
              popularity and opening up new business opportunities: big data, smart machines, the Internet of things and robotics. While it is important for businesses to leverage these technologies, they also need to embrace them with full
              confidence and make them relevant to their business personally â€” new technologies will only work when they are aligned with business goals.</li>
